# Exercise Tracker

## Description

Exercise Tracker is a full-stack web application that allows users to be created and deleted, as well as to track their exercises.  
This project was developed as part of my learning journey to strengthen and enhance my back-end web development skills.

#### PrimeReact
A React UI component library used to create forms, tables, and modals.

### Back End
